I would like to submit my project for inclusion in the ecosystem.

* Note, this project can be expedited with a PR adding your project here:
`shared/src/main/scala/org/ziverge/TrackedProjects.scala`



However, I completely understand if you are not able to dedicate additional time to add this.
Thanks again!
